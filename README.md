# COVID-19-Worldwide-cases
Created a website which shows Active, Death, Critical, New, Recovered and Total Cases who have been detected by Corona Virus

Keep the above all files and folders in one folder named "Covid"

In this the use of framework i have done is Django framework of Python.
To run the code at your end on Command Prompt type ----->python manage.py runserver<---.
Afterwards it will show one address http://127.0.0.1:8000/ Copy this and paste it on browser. 
Note:- While running the above address do not close the running directory on Command prompt. If its closed then you will get an error.

The Project shows,
  1) Active cases
  2) Recovered
  3) Death
  4) New cases
  5) Critical
  6) Total cases
